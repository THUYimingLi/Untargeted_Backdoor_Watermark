# Untargeted Backdoor Watermark: Towards Harmless and Stealthy Dataset Copyright Protection

This is the official implementation of our paper '[Untargeted Backdoor Watermark: Towards Harmless and Stealthy Dataset Copyright Protection](http://liyiming.tech/publications/)', accepted in NeurIPS 2022 (selected as **Oral** paper, TOP 2%). This research project is developed based on Python 3 and Pytorch, created by [Yiming Li](http://liyiming.tech/) and [Yang Bai](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=wBH_Q1gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

- 2022/12/31: I have updated the codes of UBW-P. I will polish the codes of UBW-C and the README.md ASAP.
- 2022/12/01: I am deeply sorry that I have recently suspended the update of this Repo, due to some personal issues such as job hunting and sickness. I will release the codes and update this repo as soon as possible. Please refer to our submitted [codes and ckpts](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/djm0zehxwrwxbae/AAB6E19WFkVY9RwtHxv2Enfba?dl=0) for some insights.
